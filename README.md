### Deployment
- Make sure you have Node.js installed and Kafka set up and running on port 9092
- Run the "build.sh" script to create the 3 databases and 2 Kafka topics
- The software is split into 7 microservices, all of which can be run seperately. We have provided a convenient index.js file in "microservice-consumer" that runs all 5 Backend microservices. The Frontend and user management microservices are controlled by seperated index.js files in their respective folders
 
### Dependencies

- Node.js with the following packages
    - cors
    - csvtojson
    - express
    - kafkajs
